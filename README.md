# track-and-field-stopwatch

This is the Arduino code for the jumbo stopwatch I made for my high school's track and field team to use during meets. This jumbo stopwatch replaced the handheld
stopwatch that was being used prior. This new jumbo stopwatch allows the crowd to view a runner's time from anywhere in the stands. The stopwatch also utilizes
a foot pressure sensor and a laser sensor for starting and stopping the runner's time.
